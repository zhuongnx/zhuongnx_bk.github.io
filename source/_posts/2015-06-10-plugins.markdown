## Excerpts

When writing a post, you can add an HTML comment `<!--more-->` to split the post for an excerpt. Only the first section of the post, before the comment, will show up on the blog index.

## HTML5 Video Tag

This plugin makes it easy to insert mp4 encoded HTML5 videos in a post. Octopress ships with javascripts which detect mp4 video support ([using Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)) and automatically offer a flash player fallback.
